 * bar's whole `low..high` range (and every priced level), each
 * `ticks_per_row × mintick` high, plus the bar-level aggregates derived from them.
 * Built once per bar and parameter set; immutable afterwards.
 *
 * The derived values follow TradingView's footprint, verified row-for-row against
 * its `request.footprint()` output: rows sit on a grid anchored at price 0; the
 * POC is the row with the largest total volume, a tie going to the row closest to
 * the middle of the footprint (the lower one when equidistant); the value area
 * grows from the POC by the larger adjacent row (a tie going to the row closer to
 * the POC, then upward) and stops BEFORE the row that would carry it past
 * `va_percent`; imbalances are diagonal at `imbalance_percent / 100`.
 *
 * Instance methods mirror the `footprint.*` namespace functions so both Pine
 * call styles work: `footprint.poc(fp)` and `fp.poc()`.
