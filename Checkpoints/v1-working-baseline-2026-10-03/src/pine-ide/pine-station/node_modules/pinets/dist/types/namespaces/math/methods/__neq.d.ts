/**
 * Pine Script na-aware inequality comparison.
 *
 * In Pine Script, any comparison involving `na` evaluates to `na` (NOT a
 * usable boolean) — verified against TradingView (`na(na != na)` is `true`):
 *   na != na   → na
 *   1  != na   → na
 *   na != 1    → na
 *
 * This cannot be implemented as `!__eq(a, b)`: `__eq(na, na)` is `na` and
 * `!na` would be `true` — wrong. Both `==` and `!=` must independently
 * propagate `na` when either operand is na. `na` is falsy, so branch/ternary
 * outcomes are unchanged; the difference is only observable via `na()`/`nz()`
 * or arithmetic on the result.
