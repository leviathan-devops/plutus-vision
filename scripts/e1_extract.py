e1_extract.py — the LEVEL EXTRACTOR. This is what was missing.

THE GAP, STATED PLAIMLY. e1_fetch.py collected pages; it produced `levels: 0` and
`zones: 0` on every run. Seven sources returned OK. Nothing turned them into a price level.
I had written a FETCHER with no EXTRACTOR — the same shape as an instrument with no probe:
it could report that it reached somewhere and never say what was there.

WHAT THIS DOES, IN ORDER, EACH STEP FROM THE CANON:
  1 · OHLC          the DXY series (S7, Yahoo's JSON API — pure code, no browser)
  2 · P1 pivots     Classic / Fibonacci / Camarilla from the prior completed week, with the
                    MANDATORY arithmetic verification the prompt calls zero-tolerance
  3 · P2 MA grid    EMA 200/100/50/20/9 at the weighted values, clustered where they concur
  4 · P5 structural swing extremes — the levels that actually swept
  5 · SCORE         0-2 per dimension across the six dimensions + the structural bonus
  6 · ZFP           base by zone type + the canon's modifiers
  7 · DEGREE        band(confluence) -> EXTREME…MINIMAL
  8 · ZONES         cluster the scored levels within the canon's tolerance, at most six

NOTHING IS INVENTED. Every number is computed from the fetched series or is `[NO DATA]`.
If a series cannot be fetched, this writes an empty document with the reason.
