/**
 * The single owner of every per-script artifact. Holds the source, lazily
 * transpiles + scans inputs on first `prepare()`, and caches the result so
 * the same Indicator instance can be passed to multiple `pine.run()` calls
 * without re-transpiling.
 *
 * Roles:
 *   - `source`            — the original Pine string or JS callback.
 *   - `input`             — live, title-keyed view of input values. Read or
 *                            mutate per key; the container itself is frozen.
 *   - `inputs`            — LEGACY title-keyed override map (constructor
 *                            arg). Kept for back-compat; merged into the
 *                            prepared inputs by `prepare()`.
 *   - `prepare(opts?)`    — idempotent: transpiles, scans inputs, runs
 *                            visible-range static analysis. Caches result.
 *   - `usesVisibleRange()`— derived from the cached prepare() result.
 *
 * For JS-function source the AST scan returns `[]`, so `input` is empty and
 * per-key writes throw "unknown title". The legacy `inputs` field still
 * works for that path.
