Artifact: `e1/vision/plutus-vision-v0.pine`
Merged SHA: `fb752a1c4152817e…` (re-measured at every gate below)
Engine: PineTS 0.10.0 via the standalone forked station `e1/vision/pine-ide-fork` on **:9641**
Fixture: EUR/USD · GBP/USD · DXY × 15m/30m/1H/4H (12 cells)

---

## ZONE 1 — THE TEST PLAN

### T-01 · namespace collision (W1 gate)
- **What:** the merge must not carry a duplicate `type` or a shadowed top-level name.
- **How:** `python3 scripts/lexcheck.py` over the 4 sources, then over the merged file.
- **PASS:** exit 0, `lexcheck: PASS (0 findings)`.
- **FAIL:** any `COLLISION type` or `SHADOW <name>` row.

### T-02 · single declaration (L-4)
- **What:** exactly one `indicator()` call.
- **How:** `grep -c '^indicator(' merged`.
- **PASS:** `1`.

### T-03 · attribution retention (L-6/L-7)
- **What:** the CC BY-NC-SA notice and © LuxAlgo survive the rebrand.
- **How:** `grep -c 'LuxAlgo' merged`.
- **PASS:** `>= 1`.

### T-04 · per-subsystem render (W2 gate)
- **What:** each of the 4 subsystems draws on its own.
- **How:** POST /run per section slice; counts from `data.counts`.
- **PASS:** `boxes+labels+lines > 0` for each.
- **FAIL:** a section drawing 0/0/0.

### T-05 · full-artifact run (L0/L2)
- **What:** the whole merged file compiles and executes.
- **How:** `node pine-ide-fork/pv_probe.mjs <file> --url :9641`.
- **PASS:** `RUN_OK` + `RENDERED`, exit 0.

### T-06 · adversarial corpus (P5)
- **What:** 28 exported decision functions probed positive + negative + edge.
- **How:** `python3 scripts/p5_adversarial.py`.
- **PASS:** positive GREEN, negative GREEN, full-artifact 12/12 GREEN.

### T-07 · behavior diff (I-4)
- **What:** no formula changed during the rename.
- **How:** normalize identifiers, assert each core shape still present.
- **PASS:** 10/10 shapes.

VERDICT            FULL PASS — ZERO confirmed defects
```
Two STEP-4 rows were adjudicated as **probe errors**, not defects — see
`P5_ADVERSARIAL_VERDICT.md` (AUD/USD 30m is absent from the fixture corpus; `limit=1`
is below the fixture's minimum slice). One real finding was recorded: the §16 box
budget is documented but NOT enforced (3 of 12 cells within 40 boxes of the 500
ceiling). **Verdict: PASS with one named OPEN finding.**

## RE-MEASURED THIS TURN - the anchor every verdict above hangs from

Re-run after every edit. A PASS is a measurement, valid only for the SHA it was taken on.

```

If the SHA changes, every verdict above is STALE and the gates must re-run.

## THE AUDIT GATE

```
AUDIT GATE: BLOCKED (no code-audit artifact on disk for this artifact)
```

No `qwen-code-audit` / `sg-ocr-*.json` run exists for `plutus-vision-v0.pine`, and the
host's audit lane was not invoked this session. Per the degraded-run law this is
**BLOCKED, never PASS** — it does not block the build's own gates (every gate above is
independently evidenced by a tool result), but it **does** block any ship-ready or
production-grade claim. The audit must be run against the merged file before P8.

---

## THE HONEST GAPS

1. **TradingView itself is unverified.** Every gate above ran on PineTS 0.10.0. The
   eight engine-compat shims in `RUNTIME_LEDGER.md` are Pine-legal constructs, but no
   run has proved TradingView's compiler accepts the merged source, and no eyes have
   seen a rendered chart. The station is a *proxy*, not the target runtime.
2. **Visual parity is counts, not pixels.** SMC and VOIDS match their sources exactly on
   object counts (5/22/19 and 94/0/0). SWEEPS source 422s on PineTS so no parity number
   exists. POOLS draws 1 box where the source draws 8 — same gate shape, fewer clusters
   on 300 bars; threshold/bar-count dependent, NOT proven benign.
3. **The box budget is unenforced** (see R-T06). On a denser market the merged file
   exceeds Pine's 500 ceiling and PineTS drops the excess silently.
4. **AUDIT GATE BLOCKED** (above).
5. **Tier-1 LuxAlgo validation never started** — the 14 Tier-1 candidates and the
   Tier-2 reserves remain unvalidated by design.

## TEST PLAN ENTRY P-07 — 2026-10-01 — the computer-use rails
### HOST
- **What:** every theatrical shape must be a refusal, and the honest path must be one call.
- **How:** `node scripts/rail-test.mjs` (first pass) and `scripts/rail-test2.mjs` (theatre shapes), driving `execute()` against the LIVE `:3` display and the real Pine IDE window.
- **PASS criteria:** claim-without-evidence REFUSED · look returns an image block · PASS-with-deltas REFUSED · ack-without-reason REFUSED · verdict-without-look REFUSED · verdict-without-expectation REFUSED · honest FAIL recordable · claim-with-evidence generated with shas · report prints the look-ratio.
- **FAIL criteria:** any of the above permitted.
- **Status:** PASSED (R-07)

## TEST RESULT R-07 — 2026-10-01 — P-07 the rails
### HOST
- **The run:** `node scripts/rail-test2.mjs` (live, display :3, window 14680067 "Plutus Vision — Pine IDE")
- **The raw output:**
  `T1 claim with no evidence   ✓ CLAIM REFUSED — nothing behind it.`
  `T2 look (one call)          ✓ image ✓ sha 35d98e22  bytes 241210`
  `T3 PASS with deltas         ✓ VERDICT REFUSED — PASS with deltas is the theatrical shape.`
  `T4 PASS forced              ✓ VERDICT PASS (override logged)`
  `T5 ack with no reason       ✓ ACK REFUSED — 1 unobserved interaction(s) claimed as observed with no reason.`
  `T6 ack with reason          ✓ ACK: 1 interaction(s) marked observed WITHOUT a capture.`
  `T7 honest FAIL              ✓ VERDICT FAIL`
  `T8 claim with evidence      ✓ VERIFICATION CLAIM — generated from 2 recorded verdict(s) · overall: FAIL`
  `T9 audit surface            look-ratio 0.67 ⚠ · acks 1 · rail refusals 5 · PASS overrides 1`
- **AUDIT GATE:** REPLACED BY DIRECT LOOK by operator order (FAILURE_LOG F-34). The prior qwen-code-audit attempt returned `GATE: BLOCKED (OCR_NO_FILES_REVIEWED)`. No code-audit artifact exists for this project; the direct-look claim is the gate for this milestone and it carries shas per frame.
- **The verdict:** PASS (all 9 shapes behaved as designed)
- **The artifacts:** ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/runs.jsonl · ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/shots/*.png

## TEST RESULT R-08 — 2026-10-01 — the VLM reader is retired (live)
### HOST
- **The run:** `curl -X POST :9754/vil/look`
- **The raw output:** `{"success":true,"data":{"retired":true,"verdict":"TRIAGE_ONLY","answers":null,"note":"VLM_READER_RETIRED: the local-VLM reader no longer issues verdicts (2026-10-01)…"}}`
- **The verdict:** PASS — the second verdict path is closed; there is now exactly one.
- **The artifacts:** PLUTUS_VISION/pine-ide/pine-ide/vil-rail.mjs (`lookAt` retired, `lookAt__retired` preserved)

## TEST RESULT R-09 — 2026-10-01 — skill corpus wiring
### SCRIPT
- **The run:** grep for `⛔ RAIL — use \`computer-use\`` across ~/.omp/agent/managed-skills/*/SKILL.md; frontmatter check per file.
- **The raw output:** `wired: direct-look-product-test, l5-chart-vision-verification, tradingview-pine-l5-render, tradingview-agent-display-render, tradingview-agent-display-pine-render, agent-display-tradingview-pine-render, pine-ide, tradingview-pine-editor-cdp-load, tradingview-pine-render-agent-display, tradingview-pine-render-and-session` · `frontmatter ok (name fields=1) × 9`
- **The verdict:** PASS — 10/10 vision skills route through the tool; 0 prescribe a raw capture as the only path.

## TEST RESULT R-10 — 2026-10-01 — the served-artifact drift (found by looking)
### HOST
- **What:** the binary the IDE renders vs the file under test.
- **How:** read the editor's visible text in the frame, compare to the source, then hash the editor's contents in-page via `crypto.subtle.digest`.
- **The raw output:** `editorSha: d7e0060997316565 · servedSha: d7e0060997316565 · header: "// BUDGET: single 500/500/500 ceiling; allocation enforced in W3 (§16)"` vs source `605bff82d3539e9e` reading `// BUDGET: one script = one 500-box ceiling. Only VOIDS is bounded…`
- **The fix + re-verify:** symlink + universal `no-store` + dead server killed → `bash scripts/verify_served_pine.sh` → `source 605bff82d3539e9e  renderer 605bff82d3539e9e  served 605bff82d3539e9e / SERVED_PINE_OK`; after a hard reload `editorSha 605bff82d3539e9e · counts {boxes:122, labels:24, lines:57} · bars 1603`.
- **The verdict:** FAIL→FIXED+PROVEN. The delta it exposed — the stale `W3 BUDGET` block and the false `zero deltas` header visible in the editor — was itself a symptom; the cause was the served copy.
- **The artifacts:** vil/direct/05-1H-FINAL.png sha 87aec75ad5176399 · vil/direct/08-menu.png sha 8a692caeeb09f1a4

## TEST RESULT R-11 — 2026-10-01 — the verdict loop across processes
### HOST
- **The run:** `bash scripts/drive.sh` (reset → expect → click → look, four separate node processes) then `node scripts/sweep.mjs verdict 'FAIL|…'`
- **The raw output:** `expectation: 1H on 605bff82… / unobserved : 0 / win : 14680067` → `VERDICT FAIL · expectation: … · found: four subsystems render; legend row present; header lines 9-19 corrected; 3 anchors dropped matching parity · missing: 3 CHoCH labels cluster within ~20px at x1090-1163 y420-435`
- **The verdict:** PASS — expectation written first, interaction counted, frame opened, verdict recorded with a named delta and the frame's sha.
- **The artifacts:** ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/runs.jsonl

| plutus-vision-v1 | b5/l57/L22 | b5/l221/L113 | b5/l205/L97 | b5/l89/L31 |

### NOT TESTED (honest remainder)
- No container round this session: every verdict is display-live, not container-grade.
- The look matrix covers 1H for all three after the D1 suppression; the other three TFs were
  measured by counts, not looked at.
- The grid's fidelity deltas are subjective and handed to the operator, not self-adjudicated.

## 2026-10-02 (later) — THE PIN EXECUTION · ALL 12 NAMED TESTS + THE AUDIT GATE

### THE AUDIT ARTIFACT
`reports/LQZ_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.txt` — the full pass, on disk, with the artifact shas at
audit time written into its header (so the audit names WHAT it audited).

## AUDIT GATE: PASS

```
  [PASS] A1 detector paint suppressed                 live colour inputs=0 transparent=10
  [PASS] A2 drawing caps raised to 500                per-deliverable: [True, True, True]
  [PASS] A3 mutant: wrong title refused               exit=1
  [PASS] A4 mutant: duplicate panels refused          exit=1 guarded
  [PASS] A5 grid artifact present                     panel-grid-1H.png 523703 bytes
  [PASS] A6 ledger carries the frame shas             3/3 shas cited
  [PASS] A7 library cross-reference clean             library 5/5 bands>0 irregular 5/5 · grids 4/4 bands>0 irregular 4/4

ADVERSARIAL VERDICT: 7/7 PASS
ZERO confirmed defects — every guard bit its mutant
```

**AUDIT GATE: PASS** — 7/7, zero confirmed defects, artifact on disk.

### WAVE 1 — `bun test scripts/lqz_core.test.ts` → 4 pass / 0 fail / 46 expect
| named test | selector | result |
|---|---|---|
| test_cluster_rejects_beyond_tol (negative, runs first) | `bun test -t test_cluster_rejects_beyond_tol` | pass |
| test_cluster_merges_within_tol (positive) | `bun test -t test_cluster_merges_within_tol` | pass |
| test_source_select_is_total (exhaustive) | `bun test -t test_source_select_is_total` | pass |
Gate: v0 parity ZERO new deltas — verified: `plutus-vision-v0.pine` sha `605bff82d3539e9e`,
byte-identical to the pin's baseline. **The parity reference was not touched.**

### WAVE 2 — `bun test scripts/lqz_render.test.ts` → 2 pass / 0 fail / 45 expect
test_zone_spans_full_width · test_colour_by_side. Positive + negative + empty in each.
Gate: every zone left edge <= bar_index-500 — verified at barIndex **1603** AND at **325**
(15m's depth) where the clamp holds the edge at 0 rather than going negative.

### WAVES 3/4/5 — `bun test scripts/lqz_ship.test.ts` → 3 pass / 0 fail / 40 expect
Each asserts the STATION compile (L0) with the run's OWN title AND the source law (L1):
| deliverable | sha256[:16] | station title asserted |
|---|---|---|
| D1 lqz-luxalgo | `b6dda2dae4416ec8` | `LQZ LuxAlgo` |
| D2 lqz-plutus | `946f4ca21b3ddc0a` | `LQZ Plutus — operator candle liquidity` |
| D3 plutus-vision-v1 | `d41c6d9ccb1c5f8e` | `Plutus Vision v1` |

### WAVE 6 — `bun test scripts/lqz_w6.test.ts` → 3 pass / 0 fail / 51 expect
test_panel_grid_complete · test_panel_rows_are_same_bars · test_ab_diff_is_measurable.

### THE PANEL VISUAL JUDGE GATE (L3/L4) — the pin's only deliverable-closing gate
Four grids, each rendered LIVE from the Pine IDE on :3, each OPENED by the agent:

| TF | grid | sha256[:16] | D1 | D2 | D3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1H | reports/panel-grid-1H.png | 07a4e3bc | 117b/36l | 0b/58l | 5b/79l/21L |
| 30m | reports/panel-grid-30m.png | 0491c90a | 145b/40l | 0b/66l | 5b/85l/19L |
| 15m | reports/panel-grid-15m.png | 5f4fcbb2 | 97b/30l | 0b/38l | 5b/57l/19L |
| 4H | reports/panel-grid-4H.png | a653c020 | 216b/50l | 0b/53l | 5b/80l/27L |

Per-panel found/missing/wrong: `reports/lqz_panel_judge.md`.
**OPERATOR VERDICT: AWAITING — no agent action substitutes for it.**

### THE RUNTIME SEAT (P4) — first person on :3
`reports/lqz_runtime_forensic.md` (154 L) carries the H1-H7 record: 8 numbered ops each
with a pre-registered expectation; the silent station death; the cold-page debounce race
(1/2/7 attempts cold vs 1/1/1 warm); the 15m shallow-history case; the 112-vs-50 cap
boundary; seven facts RUNNING produced that READING could not.

### THE LIBRARY CROSS-REFERENCE (P5)
Decisive property: **IRREGULARITY**, not the count. Measured: library 5/5 frames bands>0
AND irregular · deliverable grids 4/4 bands>0 AND irregular. A uniform spacing would be a
synthetic grid; irregular spacing is detected levels.

### NOT TESTED (the honest remainder — never reported as pass)
- **No container round.** Every verdict is host-live, not container-grade.
- **No rig crash test** beyond `limit=1` (which refuses by name: `bars absent (1)`).
- **The second-operator check is not run** — no zero-context subagent has driven it.
- **The band-height delta is unadjudicated** — the operator's call.
- render vision.mjs sha at test time: `56e9a3eb1d83e43d` · HEAD `d7dc0ce`

---

## 2026-10-02 (session 2) — THE IDE PIPELINE, THE GREY/GOLD FIX, THE FOUR GRIDS

### THE IDE'S OWN PIPELINE — found and used end to end
`P.run` · `P.capture` · `P.runGate` · `P.look` · `P.gate.{catalog,rows,verdict}`
and the verdict buttons `data-act="look-pass|look-fail|look-inconclusive"` whose own
tooltip reads **"The orchestrator's look: PASS (refused on a blank/failed frame)"**.
The operator's law — **"EVERYTHING RUNS THROUGH THE IDE"** — is now the workflow.

### THE GREY/GOLD DEFECT — SOLVED
`vision.mjs:113` read `b.color` — **a field a Pine box NEVER sets** — so all 97 boxes fell
through to the BRASS fallback `rgba(185,154,91,0.10)`. The BORDER on the very next line was
already fixed with the correct guard; **the FILL was missed, six lines apart.**
Fix: `const fill = b.bgcolor ? normColor(b.bgcolor, 'rgba(0,0,0,0)') : 'rgba(0,0,0,0)'`
**Verified: `nonBg 0.40008 → 0.16821` (a 58 % drop) and the frame goes from slabs burying the
chart to clean.**

### THE FOUR GRIDS — every panel the IDE's own capture, every one opened
| TF | D1 | D2 | D3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15m | 97b/30l | 0b/38l | **5b/57l/22L** |
| 30m | 145b/40l | **0b/66l** | **5b/85l/23L** |
| 1H | 117b/36l | 0b/58l | **5b/79l/24L** |
| 4H | 216b/50l | 0b/53l | **5b/80l/30L** |
**D3 is the only deliverable carrying all three of the library's elements — thin ladder +
large coloured bands + structure labels — at EVERY timeframe, and the only one the IDE's own
reader passed at every timeframe.**

### MEASURED LEVERS AT 15m
| lever | effect |
|---|---|
| `lqzTol` 0.5→1.5 | **none** |
| `lqzMinAgree` 2→1 | **none** |
| `lqzMaxZones` 60 | **not binding** (5 emitted) |
| **`lqzSource` = "both"** | **5 → 8 ladder lines (+60 %)** ← the only one that moves it |
The 1H-vs-15m gap (22 vs 5) is STRUCTURAL: the detectors' windows are measured in BARS and
15m carries 325 against 1H's 400.

### INSTRUMENT DEFECTS FOUND AND FIXED
1. `verify_served_pine.sh` — relative paths (false drift from any other cwd) and **1 of 4
   files**; now all four, from anywhere, `SERVED_PINE_OK`.
2. The builder's suppression was a HAND-LIST that missed `voi_lqFC`; now a PREDICATE.
3. `P.capture()` returned the byte-identical frame across THREE source versions — it reads the
   last COMPOSITED layer; **a page reload breaks the freeze.**
4. The grid composer: file-order selection (rendered a pre-fix D1) and a HARD-CODED sha map
   (D1's sha changed, so the lookup fell to a stale row); now newest-by-`createdAt` and shas
   read FROM DISK.

### THE RUNTIME LEDGER
`reports/lqz_runtime_forensic.md` — every entry above with its mechanism and its measurement.
`reports/lqz_second_operator.md` — a zero-context agent reproduced the ledger's op-1 line
digit for digit and found the launcher's health predicate reads a route that can hang.

HEAD at this entry: `b27bb49`

---

## 2026-10-02 (session 2, close) — THE RENDERER FIXES, THE RESTART, THE COMPLETE GRID SET

### THE AUDIT ARTIFACT
`reports/LQZ_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.txt` — re-run POST-FIX. Its header names the artifact shas at
audit time: D1/D2/D3 as they stand, `vision.mjs d032a26721176649`,
**`plutus-vision-v0.pine 605bff82d3539e9e` (the parity reference, UNCHANGED)**.

## AUDIT GATE: PASS

```
  [PASS] A1 detector paint suppressed                 live colour inputs=0 transparent=10
  [PASS] A2 drawing caps raised to 500                per-deliverable: [True, True, True]
  [PASS] A3 mutant: wrong title refused               exit=1
  [PASS] A4 mutant: duplicate panels refused          exit=1 guarded
  [PASS] A5 grid artifact present                     panel-grid-1H.png 523703 bytes
  [PASS] A6 ledger carries the frame shas             3/3 shas cited
  [PASS] A7 library cross-reference clean             library 5/5 bands>0 irregular 5/5 · grids 4/4 bands>0 irregular 4/4

ADVERSARIAL VERDICT: 7/7 PASS
ZERO confirmed defects — every guard bit its mutant
```

**AUDIT GATE: PASS** — 7/7, zero confirmed defects, artifact on disk.

### THE TWO RENDERER DEFECTS — one class, both fixed
**an NA/absent value reaching a renderer fallback.** Measured, at the station:
| defect | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| the box FILL read `b.color` (never set by Pine boxes) → BRASS → the grey/gold slabs | `nonBg 0.40008` | **`nonBg 0.16821`** |
| the line COLOUR went NA via an NA side → BRASS at 1px → the invisible ladder | **0 % coloured** | **100 %** on D2 and D3 |

### THE GRID SET — COMPLETE, all twelve panels post-fix
D1/D2/D3 × 15m/30m/1H/4H, every title asserted, every capture on a RESTARTED rig where each
run succeeded FIRST TRY. Grids: `15m dcd2598f · 30m 71320abb · 1H d461941e · 4H 8a3f62f2`.

**What the 15m grid shows:** D1 clean but visibly EMPTY (the supply starvation made visible);
D2 the ladder (green/red/gold full-width lines + a gold band); D3 the richest (dense ladder +
a large red band + TWELVE structure labels).

### THE UNBLOCK
The full IDE restart (`bash launch-pine-ide`) cleared a degraded shell state that SIX
approaches could not: stale frames, wrong scripts, an exhausted title loop, a frozen
compositor, an unhelpful resize, and a tab-source assignment that did not take.

### CLASS 3 — D1, the operator's calibration
D1 @ `lqzSource = "luxalgo"` emits **2 emitter lines at 15m, 4 at 1H, and 0 carry a colour** —
SUPPLY-STARVED, visible in the grid as an empty chart. Measured: `lqzTol`, `lqzMinAgree` and
`lqzMaxZones` are ALL inert against it; **`lqzSource = "both"` takes it from 0 coloured lines
to 3.** That is the operator's call.

### NOT TESTED (the honest remainder)
- **No container round.** Every verdict is host-live.
- **D1 has no post-fix LADDER** because its supply starves — by design of `lqzSource`, not a
  rendering fault.
- The composer's freshness test (frame mtime vs source mtime) is a WEAK guard: it did not
  reject two frames that proved, by matching shas on a fresh rig, to have been CORRECT anyway.

# THE RE-VERIFICATION ROUND — every gate re-run on the CURRENT tree (2026-10-02)

The pin's law: *"the orchestrator re-runs every prior gate on the combined tree."* Every number
below was produced THIS TURN, against the tree at its current sha.

## L1 · THE UNIT SUITE — `bun test ./scripts/`

```
12 pass · 0 fail · Ran 12 tests across 4 files
```

**THE RUN FORM IS THE LAW (a measured trap):** `bun test scripts/` is a **FILTER**, not a path —
it ran 24 tests across 8 files because the walk reaches the SEALED CHECKPOINT'S copies of the
same tests. `bun test ./scripts/` is the **PATH** form and runs the live four. **Canonical run:
`bun test ./scripts/`.**

**TWO DEFECTS THIS RUN SURFACED, BOTH FIXED:**

1. **`test_colour_by_side` was RED since the NA guard landed** — it pinned the PRE-GUARD string
   (`_col = _sd == 1 ? lqzColorS : lqzColorB`) while the source carries the guard
   (`lqz-luxalgo.pine:887`). The expectation now pins the guarded line, which makes it a
   regression guard for the guard itself. **Commit `f496f9a`.**
2. **`test_panel_rows_are_same_bars` went RED after any adversarial run** — it correctly
   validates *the manifest the grid produced*, and the A4 mutant's manifest (two panels, one
   source) was the last thing written to the shared `/tmp/lqz-panel`. **The test was right; the
   pollution was the defect.** `lqz-panel.mjs` now honours `LQZ_PANEL_TMP` and the mutants run
   under their own. **Commit `36373c3`.**

## L1.5 · THE ADVERSARIAL SUITE — `python3 scripts/lqz_adversarial.py`

```
[PASS] A1 detector paint suppressed                 live colour inputs=0 transparent=10
[PASS] A2 drawing caps raised to 500                per-deliverable: [True, True, True]
[PASS] A3 mutant: wrong title refused               exit=1 PANEL_GRID_FAIL: D1
[PASS] A4 mutant: duplicate panels refused          exit=1 guarded
[PASS] A5 grid artifact present                     panel-grid-1H.png
[PASS] A6 ledger carries the frame shas             3/3 shas cited
[PASS] A7 library cross-reference clean             library 5/5 bands>0 irregular 5/5

ADVERSARIAL VERDICT: 7/7 PASS
ZERO confirmed defects — every guard bit its mutant
```

**A4 FOUND A REAL DEFECT AND THE GUARD WAS STRENGTHENED (commit `bccd247`).** Adjudicated both
ways first: Side A — the mutant assumes identical sources produce identical frames, but the
chart's viewport auto-fits per run, so frames legitimately differ. Side B — **the frame guard's
own purpose ("the grid is a lie") passes undetected when two panels render one deliverable with
distinct bytes.** Real. **The fix: a SOURCE-distinctness guard** — the sha256 of each panel's
deliverable must be distinct. The real grid now prints both lines:

```
panels distinct:  D1=48bea185626c D2=e30c133199a0 D3=7e3cac8e79ff
sources distinct: D1=db06b6057412 D2=68881deaca0c D3=82da437af969
```

## L2 · THE PARITY TABLE — `python3 scripts/compare.py` (RC=0)

| subsystem | baseline (2026-10-01) | now | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMC | 195/195 | **195/195** | **EXACT MATCH** |
| POOLS | 25/25 | **25/25** | **EXACT MATCH** |
| VOIDS | 380/500 | **380/500** | **EXACT MATCH** |
| SWEEPS | 258/258 | **PINE_RUNTIME_ERROR** | **REGRESSION — NAMED RESIDUAL** |
| MERGED (the shipping ancestry) | — | ok · boxes 486 · labels 97 · lines 275 | runs |

**THE SWEEPS RESIDUAL, adjudicated and named.** The sweeps source fails with
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get_left')` on **all four timeframes** — an
absolute, not data-shaped, failure. **Adjudicated both ways:** (Side A) the source is UNCHANGED
since round-zero (one commit, `4d993b7`) and the fixture is unchanged; (Side B) the failure is
therefore in the **tooling chain** — the `get_left` symbol belongs to Vela's drawing extraction
(`velaPinets 0.2.14`), and the only moving part since the baseline measurement is the engine's
install (mtime 2026-10-01 16:33). **The impact on the deliverables is NONE** — D1 embeds the
sweeps logic (103 references) and RUNS, and the MERGED bundle runs. **Recorded in FAILURE_LOG.**

**AND THE CORRELATION THAT PROVES THE READING:** the pin's baseline `SWEEPS 258/258` and this
run's `MERGED-ONLY drawings: 258` are **the same 258** — the sweeps' drawings, matched when the
source ran, unmatched now that it cannot.

## THE AUDIT GATE

**AUDIT GATE: PASS** — the adversarial suite is 7/7 with zero confirmed defects, the unit suite is
12/12, the parity's three comparable legs match the baseline exactly, the fourth carries a named
engine-era residual, and the sealed checkpoint holds the tree at `873/873 MATCH`.


---

# THE STARVATION DRILL — the proof contract's negative case, run (2026-10-02)

**The pin's proof contract:** *"Every check is POSITIVE + NEGATIVE: a planted-defect zone set MUST
be refused; an empty detector MUST yield zero zones, never a fallback band."* **And the runtime
seat's H4: "push it: … starve the bars."** This is that drill, run against the deployed station.

## THE PROBE

For each deliverable, `POST :9741/run` at limits 1, 2, 5 and 400 on EUR/USD 1H:

| deliverable | limit=2 | limit=5 | limit=400 | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 `lqz-luxalgo` | boxes 0 · lines 0 · labels 0 | 0 · 0 · 0 | 117 · 42 · 2 | **ZERO at starvation — no fallback** |
| D2 `lqz-plutus` | 0 · 0 · 0 | 0 · 0 · 0 | 0 · 58 · 0 | **ZERO at starvation — no fallback** |
| D3 `plutus-vision-v1` | boxes **0** · lines 2 · labels 2 | 0 · 2 · 2 | 5 · 79 · 24 | **zero ZONES; see below** |

`limit=1` is refused by the station itself (no bars) — recorded, not a pass.

## THE VERDICT — the contract HOLDS

**No deliverable emits a fallback band at exhaustion.** D1 and D2 emit **nothing at all** at 2–5
bars. D3 emits **zero boxes** — its zone count is genuinely zero.

## THE ONE OBSERVATION, recorded rather than waved through

D3's 4 primitives at 2 bars are the LuxAlgo SMC's **structure labels** — `"Weak High"` /
`"Weak Low"` — and their geometry is **degenerate**:

```
label: {"time": 1783389600000, "price": null, "text": "Weak High", …}
line:  {"a": {"time": 0, "price": null}, "b": {"time": 1783389600000, "price": null}, …}
```

**`price: null` on every anchor, and a `time: 0` (epoch) left edge.** These CANNOT render — and
this is **D-XX's lesson reappearing**: *a count is not a render.* The counts say 2 labels + 2
lines; the pixels can say nothing, because there is no price to draw at. **It is not a fallback
band and not a wrong-level zone — it is dead geometry the counts still census.** RECORDED as an
observation for the operator's read; not fixed here, because the fix belongs to the SMC's own
starved-feed guard and the deliverable's zone contract is intact.

# THE H4 DRILL LEDGER — every push in the runtime-seat list, run or named (2026-10-02)

The pin's H4: *"push it: switch TF mid-render · apply an input · toggle lqzSource · starve the
bars."* This is each drill with its evidence, and the one residual NAMED per H7.

## DRILL 1 · SWITCH TF — RUN

TFs switched between 1H / 15m / 30m / 4H with a capture after every switch, dozens of times this
session: the four IDE grids exist because of it, and D1's rows read `15m 97/33/1 FAIL ·
30m 145/46/2 PASS · 1H 117/42/2 PASS · 4H 216/65/5 PASS`. **The mechanism measured mid-flight:**
`cfg.timeframe` follows the chart's market (`pine-ide.mjs:221`), and `P.loadBars({pair,
timeframe})` is the setter.

## DRILL 2 · TOGGLE lqzSource — RUN

The measured pair, twice confirmed:
`lqzSource='luxalgo'` → 117/36/**0** → **MECH_VETO → FAIL** · `lqzSource='both'` → 117/42/**2** →
**PASS**. The variant was built, served, run, captured, and LOOKED AT.

## DRILL 3 · STARVE THE BARS — RUN

The starvation drill (separate entry above): D1/D2 emit **nothing** at 2–5 bars; D3 emits zero
boxes. **No fallback band anywhere.**

## DRILL 4 · APPLY AN INPUT — RUN, by the mechanical equivalent

**The pre-registered expectation: the label count goes 2 → 0 when `lqzLabel` is off.** Measured
directly through the deployed station:

```
lqzLabel=true  (the shipped default):  boxes=117  lines=42  labels=2
lqzLabel=false (the toggle applied):   boxes=117  lines=42  labels=0
```

**The knob works. And the gate's law is CONSISTENT with it:** `boxes>0 · labels=0` is exactly
what `gate.mjs:157`'s MECH_VETO refuses — so the operator's own toggle produces an unlabelled
chart AND the gate refuses it, which is the same law that failed the old shipped default. **The
knob, the default, and the veto now agree about what "unlabelled" means.**

## THE NAMED RESIDUAL · THE SETTINGS DIALOG ITSELF — UNRUN

**The pin's H2 names "the settings dialog" as a first-person op. It was attempted and could not
be reached:** clicking `[title="Indicator settings"]` opens the chart's *Indicators browser*
(Symbol Search / Indicators / Change timeframe), and the legend's ⚙ button (found, rect
`918,49 15x13`, clicked with a full pointer sequence) opened nothing. The renderer's exposed
surface carries `settingsDialog` (null prototype), `input` (the mouse handler, not the
indicator inputs) and `indicatorSlices` (`{drawScene, sliceCache, tips}` — the render slice
machinery, not the studies) — **the dialog's own internals are not reachable from the exposed
API.** Per H7 the residual is NAMED rather than waved: **DRILL 4's evidence stands on the
station's own input path, and the dialog UI remains unexercised by this driver.**


---

# CORRECTION + DISAMBIGUATION — the parity instruments, measured properly (2026-10-02)

## THE CORRECTION — MY OWN MEASUREMENT ERROR

The re-verification entry above records `compare.py`'s result as `RC=0`. **That was WRONG: the
`RC=$?` captured the exit of the `| tail` PIPELINE, not of the script.** Measured properly this
turn:

```
python3 scripts/compare.py > /tmp/compare.out 2>&1; RC=$?   ->   exit=1
VERDICT: DELTA lost=121 extra=258
```

**compare.py exits 1 on any loss** (its own header: *"exits 1 on any loss"*). The corrected
record stands: **the script IS RED** on the current engine state, per its own contract. **The
error is recorded rather than quietly overwritten — the correction is the point of keeping the
log.**

## THE DISAMBIGUATION — TWO INSTRUMENTS, TWO DIFFERENT SUBJECTS

**`verify_four.py` runs the FOUR SUBSYSTEMS INSIDE THE MERGED BUNDLE** (it slices the merged
file's sections and runs each segment standalone). Measured this turn:

```
SMC      PASS  boxes=5    labels=22   lines=19
SWEEPS   PASS  boxes=12   labels=0    lines=24
VOIDS    PASS  boxes=94   labels=0    lines=0
POOLS    PASS  boxes=1    labels=0    lines=2
4/4: 4/4 subsystems executed
```

**`compare.py` runs the ORIGINAL SOURCES in `sources/`** against the merged.

**⇒ THE SHIPPING LOGIC IS GREEN IN BOTH SENSES THAT MATTER:** the merged bundle's own sweeps
section runs (**verify_four 4/4**), and the deliverable that ships (**D1**) embeds that logic
(103 `swp_` references) and runs at every TF. **The failing leg is the comparison INPUT** — the
standalone `sources/liquidity-sweeps.pine` (UDT-heavy), which fails in Vela's extraction on the
current engine build. That is F-XX, and its bounds are unchanged.

## WHY THE ENGINE-VERSION THEORY DOES NOT HOLD — checked, not assumed

The pin-the-engine resume condition was probed this turn: **there is no drift to pin back.**
`package-lock.json` resolves `pinets 0.10.0` and `@luxalgo/vela-pinets 0.2.14`; the disk holds
**exactly those** (`pinets 0.10.0 · vela-pinets 0.2.14 · vela 0.8.0`). The locked build installed
on 2026-10-01 16:33. **So the sweeps regression is NOT a version drift** — with the source, the
fixture and the locked engine all unchanged, the failure is reproducible and the baseline
`258/258` is not; **F-XX stands as an open, bounded, named residual** with its resume condition
corrected to: re-measure compare.py when the engine's extraction of UDT-sourced drawing geometry
is reconciled — the version pin is not the lever.

# THE CANON AUDIT + THE GENERATOR REPAIR (2026-10-02)

## THE AUDIT — the pin's doc gate, measured

**The pin's canon gate: "200+ lines, >=3 file:line refs, the 5 read-first docs agree on the
SHA."** Measured against disk: **9 of 12 docs were UNDER the 200-line floor** (BUILD_STATE 126 ·
CANON_MANIFEST 28 · CHANGELOG 49 · COMPACTION_SURVIVAL 47 · DECISION_CHAIN 45 · EVIDENCE_STATE
83 · NEXT_STEPS 86 · POST-COMPACTION_PROMPT 70 · TASK_QUEUE 54), the manifest's SHA block read
**D1 `b6dda2dae441`** while D1 had long moved to `db06b6057412`, and the read-first docs carried
**no block at all**.

## THE INCIDENT — the canonical generator clobbered its own docs

The canon is GENERATED (`scripts/gen_canon.py`, *"re-run after every milestone"*). Re-running it
as maintenance cost **642 lines across 12 files**: `RUNNING_BUILD_LOG` fell **255 → 23** and
`RUNNING_DEBUG_LOG` **214 → 29** — docs whose own titles say **"append-only"**, while
`gen_canon.py:410` called `write_text` unconditionally.

**RECOVERED, NOT LOST:** all twelve files were committed (`git checkout HEAD -- context_management/`
restored them; 255/214/231 verified back). **The incident is recorded rather than quietly
overwritten — a generator that says "append" and clobbers is a data-loss bug, and git is the only
reason it was not permanent.**

## THE REPAIR — the contract enforced in code, three parts

1. **APPEND-SAFE:** `CHANGELOG` / `RUNNING_BUILD_LOG` / `RUNNING_DEBUG_LOG` now keep their entire
   history below a `<!-- LQZ:APPEND-BELOW -->` marker; the generated head refreshes each run.
   **Measured after the fix: 281 / 246 / 74 lines — history kept AND head refreshed.**
2. **HAND-PRESERVING:** every other doc keeps its `<!-- LQZ:CANON-HAND -->` … `<!--
   /LQZ:CANON-HAND -->` blocks verbatim while the generated inventory refreshes around them.
   (The manifest already carried a marker convention — `<!-- LQZ-SHA-BLOCK -->` — this
   generalises it.)
3. **THE SHA BLOCK IS GENERATED:** the 5 read-first docs (`POST-COMPACTION_PROMPT`,
   `CURRENT_STATE`, `BUILD_STATE`, `EVIDENCE_STATE`, `NEXT_STEPS`) now receive a verbatim SHA
   block **stamped from disk on every run** — the pin's *"the 5 read-first docs agree on the
   SHA"* is now mechanically true instead of hand-carried. **Measured: all five carry the block,
   D1 reading `db06b60574125039`.**

## THE FLOORS — the fill

`CURRENT_STATE` cleared 200 from its regenerated head alone (203). The remaining docs receive
hand-written sections inside their markers (the writer's report follows this entry) so the floor
holds **across** regenerations, never by a longer generated head.

# THE LIBRARY CROSS-REFERENCE — the pin's adversarial law, run (2026-10-02, post-reboot)

**The pin: *"Cross-reference every emitted zone against the library panels: is the band where
the library band is, within tolerance?"* Triggered by the operator's question: between the two
LQZ indicators, which is more accurate — `lqz-plutus` (theirs) or `lqz-luxalgo` (LuxAlgo's
three bundled).**

## THE INSTRUMENT

`scripts/measure_ladder.py` — pixel forensics, no eye, no VLM: rows classified by
**saturation + brightness** (the chart background is a gradient, so modal-colour fails); a row
whose saturated pixels span **>40 % of the width** is a ladder line (**full-width is the
qualification**); adjacent rows group into bands (thickness counted); each band's modal colour
classes GREEN/teal · RED · other; the centre-to-centre spacing census decides irregular
(detected levels) vs regular (a fixed grid).

## THE SUBJECTS

- **Reference: the operator's FIVE `WINNING_TRADE_LIBARARY/LIQUIDITY LADDERS` hand-charts.**
- **D1 `lqz-luxalgo` and D2 `lqz-plutus` panels from ONE grid run** (`bun scripts/lqz-panel.mjs
  1H` → `/tmp/lqz-panel/{D1,D2}.png`) — identical bars (EUR/USD 1H), same chrome, same session.

## THE DATA

| | LIBRARY (5 charts) | D1 lqz-luxalgo | D2 lqz-plutus |
|---|---|---|---|
| GREEN/teal bands | **55 (77 %)** | **0** | 18 (58 %) |
| RED bands | 16 (22 %) | 6 (100 %) | 13 (42 %) |
| green per chart | 4 · 22 · 8 · 9 · 4 | 0 | 18 |
| spacing | all 5 IRREGULAR | IRREGULAR | IRREGULAR |
| coverage (row %) | 65–74 | 43–92 | 89–92 |
| distinct levels | 14/14 | 6/7 | 22/34 |

## THE VERDICT

**D2 (`lqz-plutus`) is the closer match to the library, on the structural dimension that
matters: SIDES.** D1 rendered **zero green/demand bands** on this fixture (0 of 6) while **every
one of the five library charts is green-dominant** (all five G > R; aggregate 3.4:1). D2 emits
both sides with a green lean and the densest level detection (22 distinct spacings vs D1's 6).

## THE CAVEATS, stated with the verdict

1. The library charts are **GBPUSD 15m**; the panels are **EUR/USD 1H** — this measures the
   ladder's CHARACTER (sides, density, irregularity, coverage), never level-for-level identity.
2. The fixture is a **downtrend** (1.16 → 1.13), which biases any detector toward the supply
   side — part of D1's all-red mix is regime, part is algorithm; D2 found both sides anyway.
3. D1's two brass (#B69859) bands are the known no-colour fallback class (D-XX family), still
   unfixed.
4. n=5 references — direction, not proof.

## THE ROUND ALSO FIXED — the reboot-cleared manifest

The post-reboot suite read `9 pass · 3 fail` (`test_panel_grid_complete`,
`test_panel_rows_are_same_bars`, `test_ab_diff_is_measurable`). **Mechanism: the three are
consumer tests of the W6 grid's artifacts, and the reboot cleared `/tmp` — including
`/tmp/lqz-panel/manifest.json`.** The fix is the regeneration the tests' own contract assumes:
`bun scripts/lqz-panel.mjs 1H` → `PANEL_GRID_OK` (with the distinctness guards printing
`panels distinct` and `sources distinct`) → **suite back to `12 pass · 0 fail`.** The same regen
produced the fresh panels the cross-reference above measures — one action, two obligations
served.

# THE TRIO COMPLETE — D3 measured, and why it equals D2 on the ladder (2026-10-02)

**The cross-reference above measured D1 and D2. D3's panel was measured this turn, through the
same instrument, to close the set:**

| | **LIBRARY** (5 charts) | **D1 lqz-luxalgo** | **D2 lqz-plutus** | **D3 plutus-vision-v1** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GREEN/teal bands | **55 (77 %)** | **0** | 18 | **18** |
| RED bands | 16 (22 %) | 6 | 13 | **13** |
| other | 4 | 2 | 4 | **4** |
| spacing | all IRREGULAR | IRREGULAR | n=34 · d=22 · min 2.0 · max 84.0 | **n=34 · d=22 · min 2.0 · max 84.0** |

**D3's ladder is IDENTICAL to D2's — and that is coherence, not a copy error.** The panels are
distinct artifacts (the grid's own guard printed `panels distinct: D1=000cb8a202ff
D2=9257c244d9a3 D3=f4e848cdae1b`), but the LADDER instrument counts only **full-width saturated
rows**, and **D2 and D3 share the same LQZ renderer over the same fixture** — D3 adds the SMC's
boxes and structure lines, which are shorter than the instrument's >40 %-of-width threshold and
therefore outside its count. **The instrument measures the liquidity ladder; on that axis D2 and
D3 are the same emitter, as designed (D3 = D2's ladder + the SMC layer).**

**SO THE COMPLETE READING OF THE OPERATOR'S QUESTION:** on the library's own signature
(green-dominant, both sides, irregular, full-width), **both of the operator's indicators match
and LuxAlgo's bundle does not** (0 of 6 bands on the demand side). Between `lqz-plutus` and
`lqz-luxalgo` the answer is `lqz-plutus`, and `plutus-vision-v1` carries that same ladder plus
the SMC layer on top.

# THE THREE-CONTROL LIVE TEST — vision-hotseat on the operator's path (2026-10-02)

**The operator's standing order, recorded verbatim: "UNIT TESTS ARE THEATRICAL BULLSHIT. VISION
IN THE LOOP. LIVE DASHBOARD TEST. THATS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS OR COUNTS."** This round
executed the vision-hotseat protocol against the Pine IDE's own controls — real CDP mouse
events, outcomes polled, every frame opened.

## THE THREE CONTROLS, EACH: PROBE → REAL CLICK → OUTCOME FROM THE ARTIFACT

| control | probe (size + hit-test) | the click | outcome asserted from | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **▶ RUN** | `57×23`, `elementFromPoint` = itself | `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` mouseMoved→mousePressed→mouseReleased at (39, 481) | a FRESH compile: **`COMPILED 392ms`** (prior 422ms), D3's counts intact — and the :3 frame I opened shows the same numbers | **PASS** |
| **◎ CAPTURE** | `85×23`, hit-test self | real click at (116, 481) | a FRESH evidence PNG **`evidence/pineshell-2026-W29-1790943075820.png`**, opened: D3's ladder + CHoCH/BOS/EQL, Jun 26–Jul 4 | **PASS** |
| **⚑ GATE** | `64×23`, hit-test self | real click at (196, 481) | a NEW LEDGER ROW on disk: `82da437af969 · 1H · reader=PASS · deltas=[ANCHOR_DROPPED:3]`, **created 12 s before the read** | **PASS** |

**No JS `.click()` was used anywhere. Every outcome was polled, never sleep-and-hoped. The
second reader (my own eyes on the PNG) agreed with the instrument on every frame.**

**THE DETERMINISM CHECK, third occurrence:** the CAPTURE's sha (`8c1fe08fd6a5`) matched an
earlier D3 frame — so it was **verified fresh by opening it**, not assumed from the sha. It is
the current render. **A sha-match is an inference; the content is the truth.**

## THE ONE CONTROL DELIBERATELY UNTESTED

**PASS / FAIL / INCONCL. — the operator's verdict.** The mechanism is the same control path
proven three times above, but a machine press would impersonate the operator's judgment. The
buttons write `orchestratorVerdict`; the press is theirs.

## THE UNIT — 127 FOUND, FIXED, PROVEN

The hardening unit's first live run: the launcher completed (**station, rail, server all up**)
then exited **127** at its final line — `timeout 120 bun scripts/pv-load.mjs` — because `bun`
lives in `~/.bun/bin`, absent from the unit's PATH. **The unit reported `failed` while the rig
was half-up: loud but misleading.** Fixed with `Environment=PATH=…:~/.bun/bin:…`; re-run
through systemd: **`start exit: 0`, `active (exited)`, all four ports 200.**

## THE RELIGHT — the display was emptied by a profile race, not by the reboot

After the unit's failed run the display showed nothing. Root cause, measured: **two chrome
generations on ONE profile** (the unit's chrome + a repair-launch chrome) — the profile lock
left one instance windowless. Fixed: all 13 chrome processes killed by PID, profile wiped,
**one** chrome relit with `DISPLAY=:3` → window `4194307` on :3 → D3 loaded and asserted on
`sourceSha 82da437af969`. **The law this taught: one chrome per profile, and the launcher's
kill-then-start order is load-bearing.**

# THE MID-RENDER TF SWITCH — the last unrun H4 drill, executed (2026-10-02)

**The pin's H4: *"push it: switch TF mid-render · apply an input · toggle lqzSource · starve the
bars."* Three were run in earlier rounds; this is the fourth.**

## THE DRILL, WITH ITS PRE-REGISTERED EXPECTATION

**Fire a run; 120 ms later — while it is in flight — switch the timeframe.** Acceptable
outcomes: the shell's guard discards the in-flight run (`WORKSPACE_SWITCHED`), or the run
completes cleanly on its own TF and the switch re-renders. **Unacceptable: a crash, a silent
mixed state, or a hang.**

## THE OUTCOME — clean handling, double-read

**The instrument (CDP):**
```
run: ok=true · title "Plutus Vision v1" · tf 1H · srcSha 82da437af969   (completed on its own bars)
foot (polled): "COMPILED 463ms · 5 boxes · 80 lines · 27 labels"
running: false
```

**The second reader (the :3 frame, opened):** the timeframe row reads **`4h`** selected, the
chart shows the **4H window (Jun 4 – Jul 2, `bars 451`)**, and the footer reads
**`COMPILED 463ms · 0 plots · 5 boxes · 80 lines · 27 labels · bars 451`** — **every number
identical to the CDP read.** Status line: `FIXTURE · EUR/USD · 4H · 451 bars · rail :9754 ·
station UP`.

**Verdict: PASS.** The in-flight run finished on 1H; the switch landed; the chart re-rendered on
4H with a fresh compile; no crash, no mixed state, no hang. **STATE/UI AGREEMENT confirmed as a
side-effect: the footer's numbers, the status line's bar count, and the run payload all agree.**

## THE H4 LEDGER, COMPLETE

| drill | round | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| switch TF mid-render | THIS round | **PASS** — clean completion + re-render, double-read |
| apply an input | earlier | **PASS** — `lqzLabel` true→false → labels 2→0, the pre-registered expectation met |
| toggle lqzSource | earlier | **PASS** — `luxalgo` 117/36/0/FAIL vs `both` 117/42/2/PASS |
| starve the bars | earlier | **PASS** — no fallback band (D1/D2 zero; D3 zero boxes) |

**And the three operator controls, live with real mouse input (previous round): RUN · CAPTURE ·
GATE — each probed for size + hit-testability, clicked via `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`, outcome
asserted from the artifact, frame opened by eye.**

# TESTING LOG — THE 2026-10-03 CALIBRATION ROUND

## THE TEST PLAN (what was going to be proven, before anything was touched)

| # | scenario | pass token (in a TOOL RESULT) | fail token |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | the artifact compiles and publishes on the rig | `"ok":true` + a non-zero drawings count | any compile error; `PLUTUS_NO_STORE` |
| T2 | the box fill renders | `boxesWithColor == boxes` | any box lacking `color`/`bgcolor` |
| T3 | no price level paints twice | `IDENTICAL_dups == 0` | any duplicate |
| T4 | no opposite-side overlap | `CROSS_SIDE == 0` | any pair |
| T5 | liquidity is ONE class | the colour census shows a single liquidity colour | any second liquidity colour |
| T6 | the LuxAlgo SMC section is untouched | the SMC box shas/inputs unchanged | any SMC edit |

## THE RESULTS (every number from a tool result; nothing estimated)

```
T1  compile + publish      PASS   sha 0d20e8314ce992fc, boxes 32, labels 24, lines 48
T2  the box fill renders   PASS   boxesWithColor 39/39  (before: 0/39)
T3  no duplicate bands     PASS   IDENTICAL_dups 0     (before: n/a — never measured)
T4  no cross-side overlap  PASS   CROSS_SIDE 0         (before: 8)
T5  liquidity is one class PASS   #2E8B5773 x27       (before: #B84A4A73 x17 + #3E9B8F73 x10)
T6  SMC section untouched   PASS   #f77c8033 x3 + #3179f533 x2, unchanged
```

## THE GEOMETRY INSTRUMENT (one definition, applied to both images)

```python
def isband(r, g, b):
    mx, mn = max(r,g,b), min(r,g,b)
    if mx - mn < 22 or mx < 70: return False
    return (g >= r and b >= r and g > 80) or (r >= g and r > 110 and b >= g)
# a vertical column scan at 45% width; contiguous ink runs = the bands
```
Applied to `WINNING_TRADE_LIBARARY/LIQUIDITY LADDERS` and to our own capture in the same turn,
so the comparison is apples-to-apples.

## THE KNOWN-GAP REGISTER (measured, stated, not dressed as a pass)

| gap | state | why |
|---|---|---|
| E1 (9 pillars, confluence, ZFP, BoM/MoM, reaction counter, fortress) | **ABSENT** | never built; the grep census reads 0. Scoped in `artifacts/PLUTUS_VISION_V2_E1E2_SPEC.md` |
| E2 (shape taxonomy, decision matrix, ZFP transitions, day decomposition, speed rule, TF matching) | **ABSENT** | never built; same spec |
| the LuxAlgo S/D against the canon notes | **UNVERIFIED** | the operator's own words are that the LuxAlgo SMC "already does this perfectly"; no independent check against Forex SMC Notes(1)/(2) was performed — the 5 SMC boxes were not audited for origin-candle correctness |
| band-count parity with the library | **NOT MATCHED** | library 16 bands/column at W29-ish scale; ours 27. The gap is the DETECTOR's sensitivity (`lqzTol`, `lqzMinAgree`, `lqzSwingLen`), not the renderer — the renderer is now verified correct |
| the four-timeframe sweep | **NOT RUN this round** | the calibration was measured at 1H W29 only |
| TradingView-native compile | **NOT RUN** | the PineTS station compiles it here; the real TradingView compiler has not seen this build |

## THE HONEST VERDICT
The RENDERER is verified: correct palette, correct fill, correct geometry, zero duplicates, zero
cross-side, liquidity in one class, SMC untouched. The LIQUIDITY DETECTOR reads as accurate to
the operator's own eye ("the liquidity is extremely accurate… 90 plus accuracy just from looking
at the chart"), but that is an OPERATOR JUDGMENT, not a measured accuracy figure — no precision/
recall against a labelled set exists. The SUPPLY/DEMAND accuracy question is UNANSWERED: the LuxAlgo
SMC was deliberately not touched and never audited. The next honest test is a supply/demand audit
against Forex SMC Notes(1)/(2), not more visual tuning.

## 2026-10-03 — THE V2 BUILD: the plan and the results

THE PLAN, in the pin's order — each wave's tests run BEFORE the next wave exists:
  WAVE 1  ST-1..ST-5   the adversarial cases first: no fabrication, the temporal
                        boundary, the notional trap, the arm control, the DEAD ARM.
  WAVE 2  ST-6..ST-9b  the ≤6 cap, the degree bands, the Monday anchor, and the
                        v1 floor — which is the hard stop on the whole build.
  WAVE 3  ST-10..ST-13  anchoring, THE HARD-WALL RULE, the day decomposition with
                        the +1 day speed rule, the chain bounds.
  WAVE 3b ST-14..ST-17 the render: one line not a filled area, the dashed ghost,
                        Rule 1 at the render, no hard-coded timestamps.

THE RESULTS
  scripts/e1_tests.py         14/14   PASS
  scripts/e1_render_tests.py   23/23   PASS
  scripts/e2_tests.py         29/29   PASS
  scripts/e2_render_tests.py   18/18   PASS
  TOTAL                        66/66   PASS, every assertion paired with a
                                       negative control.

THE DENSITY INSTRUMENT AND ITS OWN CONTROL
  scripts/measure_density.py draws 4 synthetic bands of known 5px thickness and
  reads them back before it is allowed to measure anything. This exists because the
  previous instrument could not: it scored a row "covered" if ANY ink pixel existed,
  so a 1px hairline scored a 99% PASS and the library's "1px" target was recorded from
  our own defect. AN INSTRUMENT THAT CANNOT FAIL ITS CONTROL CERTIFIES THE DEFECT.

  MEASURED, our chart against the operator's library, same instrument both sides:
    band COUNT     ours 21   library 14 (range 4-22)   -> IN RANGE
    median THICK   ours 14.0px  library 7.5px           -> ours 1.9x thicker
    ink column     ours 37.1%  library 55.1%            -> ours LESS ink
  THE CORRECTION: my "very dense" was an EYEBALL claim and the measurement contradicts
  it on count. The real delta is THICKNESS, and lqzTol / lqzThickE are RUNTIME INPUTS
  in the v1 module — tuning them is an operator dial, not a code edit, so the seal
  holds.

THE KNOWN-GAP REGISTER
  | gap | state | why |
  |---|---|---|
  | no E1 zone has ever rendered | OPEN | every source returned [NO DATA] on this |
  | | | host. The refusal is correct; the pipeline has not yet been SHOWN producing |
  | | | a zone. This is the one deliverable not demonstrated. |
  | TradingView-native compile | NOT RUN | the PineTS station compiled it here |
  | band thickness vs the library | MEASURED | 1.9x thicker; a runtime dial, not code |

## 2026-10-03 — THE SMOKE FIXTURE: WHAT IT PROVED AND WHAT IT CAUGHT

scripts/smoke_e1_payload.py writes six zones to data/e1-smoke/ (NEVER data/e1/) with
ids prefixed SMOKE- and a WARNING field, so a fixture can never be mistaken for a
canon score. The build reads it through PV2_DATA_DIR, so the real builder stays
honest.

WHAT IT PROVED (live rig, EURUSD 1H W29, sha 45e5d09809e4a26b):
  the score -> band mapping is correct on a real frame —
    13/14 -> EXTREME   11/14 -> HEAVY   9/14 -> MODERATE_HEAVY
     7/14 -> MODERATE   5/14 -> LIGHT    2/14 -> (MINIMAL) ABSENT
  and MINIMAL painting NOTHING is confirmed, not assumed.

WHAT IT CAUGHT: the E1 zone BOXES do not render. The frame gained six labels and the
box census stayed at 32 with a colour census of {#3179f533:2, #f77c8033:3,
#2E8B5773:27} — nothing in the E1 degree ramp. Recorded as F-17, OPEN.

THE LESSON THIS FIXTURE PROVES ABOUT ITSELF: its first version inspected LABELS,
and labels passed on a frame whose zones were invisible. The instrument has to look
at the GEOMETRY, not at the annotation about the geometry.

## 2026-10-03 — THE RIG CACHE INVALIDATED THE F-17 MEASUREMENTS (F-18)

`run()` returns a cached payload unless the page is hard-reloaded. Two different builds
returned the identical sourceSha and the identical census — six SMOKE labels on the build
that has none. Every F-17 probe after the first was therefore reading stale bytes, and the
conclusion "the E1 boxes do not render" is NOT ESTABLISHED.

RE-VERIFICATION PROTOCOL, now binding for this rig:
  about:blank -> /pine.html -> verify the EDITOR holds the build under test -> run ->
  record the returned sha AND the editor's held-source marker together -> read the census.
  A returned sha that does not match the held source is VOID.

F-17 REMAINS OPEN AND UNMEASURED. The degree-band mapping is proven (labels). The box path
is unproven. The next attempt starts with the protocol above, not with another hypothesis.
