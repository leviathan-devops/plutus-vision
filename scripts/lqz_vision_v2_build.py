lqz_vision_v2_build.py — DELIVERABLE: plutus-vision-v2.pine.

THE INVARIANT: v1 IS NOT TOUCHED. The pin says "ADD ONLY — the V1 baseline is
untouchable. `ST-9` / `ST-9b` are the mechanism; intention is not a control."

So this is NOT the v1 build with extra modules bolted on. It is a SEPARATE artifact
that CONTAINS v1 verbatim and then adds the two engines:

    plutus-vision-v1.pine   (sealed, sha 0d20e8314ce992fc — READ ONLY, never rewritten)
      + plutus-vision-lqz/e1-render.pine     the institutional pressure map
      + plutus-vision-lqz/e2-render.pine     the predicted price path

v1's three protected layer counts (LuxAlgo SMC 226 · SMC order blocks 6 · LQZ
bands 4) must read identically in v2 — that is ST-9, and ST-9b diffs the two
v1 modules against the sealed checkpoint byte-for-byte.

THE E1/E2 PAYLOADS: the engines are PYTHON. This script injects their OUTPUT as
Pine literals at build time, so the shipped .pine is self-contained and Pine never
computes a confluence or a shape. An empty payload renders nothing and says why —
it never invents a zone or a path.
