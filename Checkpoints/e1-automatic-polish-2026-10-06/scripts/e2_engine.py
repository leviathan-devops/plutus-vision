# ── §6.1 · THE INTRADAY LEG TEMPLATES (the FINE E2 path) ────────────────────
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured defect 2026-10-05): the E2 payload carried ONE point per
# day (five points, Mon-Fri), so the render's polyline drew a FIVE-VERTEX TRIANGLE,
# not a price path. The operator's read of the live chart: "it does not resemble
# price action." The fix is DATA, not render: the day anchors stay, but each day now
# expands into a FINE, JAGGED leg that reads as price continuation.
#
# THE CANON BASIS: Trident_System_Prompt_v5.3.3 §6.1 defines every macro shape by the
# price↔zone RELATIONSHIP — SS "oscillates within a defined range bounded by IP zones
# above and below"; WL a "rapid, violent directional move that immediately reverses —
# spike-and-reject"; BS "breaks decisively through a zone, then surges directionally";
# R "temporary stabilisation or mild retracement" (its variant RS a "sharp directional
# move"); WLS "an extended sequence of rapid, explosive whiplash moves"; PBS/PWL/PRWL
# the piercing variants. §6.8 supplies each shape's expected DURATION, and §6.4/§6.4.1
# its transitions. The canon does NOT specify the intraday LEG GEOMETRY (how many
# points a day's line should bend through), so the templates below are a DERIVED
# canonical form — defined ONCE here, documented against the §6.1 definition each one
# renders, and applied uniformly. They are not invented silently: each comment names
# the canon sentence it draws.
#
# EACH TEMPLATE is a list of (u, w):
#   u ∈ [0,1]   the fraction of the day's session (the TIME axis)
#   w ∈ [-1,1]  the WIGGLE, a dimensionless price offset, normalised so max|w| = 1
# with w(0) = w(1) = 0 for EVERY template, so each day's leg STARTS and ENDS exactly
# on its day anchor and consecutive days CHAIN with no discontinuity. The day's net
# travel is carried separately (the anchor-to-anchor span, below); the template only
# adds the shape's CHARACTER on top of that trend. A flat span (two days anchored to
# the same zone) therefore still moves — the range-bound oscillation an SS/SWING day
# must show, instead of a dead straight line.

    INPUT  `days`: the day anchors the build already computed, one tuple per day —
                   (x_ms, y_price, shape, confidence). `y_price` is the day's key
                   zone level; `x_ms` is the day's +1-day (speed-rule) timestamp.
    OUTPUT (xs, ys, shapes, confs) — four equal-length lists. xs/ys are the fine path
                   (many points per day, x in epoch ms for `xloc=bar_time`). `shapes`
                   and `confs` are "" / 0 at every intraday point and carry the day's
                   shape + confidence ONLY at the five day-boundary points, so the

                   in between (Rule 1: a point with no shape is never tagged).

    THE CHAIN LAW: day i's leg runs over [x_i, x_i + day_ms] and its last point is the
    FIRST point of day i+1 (which is de-duplicated), so the polyline is one continuous
    stroke with no seam and no gap. Day i's PRICE is a straight trend from its own
    anchor to the NEXT day's anchor (so the day-level chain the engine emitted is
    preserved — the week still walks R → WL → SS by zone) PLUS the shape's template
    wiggle on top. The last day has no successor, so its span is 0 and its template
    draws the FORESIGHT TAIL the week ends on (§6.10's tail), one day past the last
    anchor.

    An unknown/empty shape falls back to the SS (range/oscillation) template — the
    canon's own default weekly storyline (§6.3 "SS → BS → R → WL"). Empty `days`
