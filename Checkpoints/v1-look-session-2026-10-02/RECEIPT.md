# SEAL — v1-look-session — 2026-10-02

Parent commit: 554a42fe2da1108fc091aa2e070e6a1b001f08d2
Branch: main

## WHAT THIS SEAL PRESERVES
The state in which all three deliverables were LOOK-verified on the live display and
the 4-panel judgment grid was written for the operator's APPROVED. Every visual verdict
BEFORE this session was read off stacked layers and is void; these are the first.

## THE COMMITS THIS SEAL COVERS
```
  554a42f test(lqz): the adversarial battery — 6/6, every guard bit its mutant
  af3a6e6 feat(lqz): W6 panel grid — 4 panels [library|D1|D2|D3], look-verified
  d6c633d fix(lqz): D1 — silence the detectors' paint, keep their detection (look-verified)
  c6a681a docs(lqz): the visual ledger — three panels looked at, D1 FAILS the look
  4530933 chore: sync served renderer copies
  122eb16 fix(vision): the frame swap must actually clear — every visual verdict was on stacked layers
```

## VERIFICATION STATE AT SEAL TIME
- adversarial battery: 6/6 PASS, ZERO confirmed defects (scripts/lqz_adversarial.py)
- the grid: reports/panel-grid-1H.png 2002x1340, panels distinct (3 distinct shas)
- the looks: D2 PASS / D3 PASS / D1 PASS after two fix rounds
- tree: clean at 554a42fe2da1108fc091aa2e070e6a1b001f08d2

## OPEN AT SEAL TIME (not defects, not hidden)
1. the operator has NOT yet recorded APPROVED on the panel grid (SPEC step-4 gate)
2. fidelity deltas awaiting the operator's call: D2 denser than the library, D3 fills
   heavier, grid footer overlaps the bottom-left panel a few pixels
3. no container round this session - every verdict is display-live, not container-grade
4. BUILD_REPORT.md sits at 102 lines against its 2000-line class floor; the material
   for it exists across the canon docs and was not padded to hit a number

## HOW TO RESUME
1. read docs/CURRENT_STATE.md then docs/NEXT_STEPS.md
2. open reports/panel-grid-1H.png - that image is the operator's judgment surface
3. bash launch-pine-ide lqz-plutus.pine EUR/USD 1H   # the proven load path
4. bun scripts/lqz-panel.mjs 1H                      # regenerate the grid
5. python3 scripts/lqz_adversarial.py                # the guards must still bite
