# The week is DERIVED from the chart's own bars — the anchor law (e1_week.py) is the chart's
# LAST BAR, never a literal (measured 2026-10-05: a hard-coded WEEK made the zones stale for
# every week but one). Override per run only when you mean it:
#   make e1 PAIR=EUR/USD                 # week auto-derived from the fixture the chart serves
#   make e1 WEEK=2026-07-06 PAIR=DXY     # an explicit week (the extractor overrides it to the
#                                        # chart's week if they disagree, with a loud line)
