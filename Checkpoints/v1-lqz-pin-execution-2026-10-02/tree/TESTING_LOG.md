Artifact: `e1/vision/plutus-vision-v0.pine`
Merged SHA: `fb752a1c4152817e…` (re-measured at every gate below)
Engine: PineTS 0.10.0 via the standalone forked station `e1/vision/pine-ide-fork` on **:9641**
Fixture: EUR/USD · GBP/USD · DXY × 15m/30m/1H/4H (12 cells)

---

## ZONE 1 — THE TEST PLAN

### T-01 · namespace collision (W1 gate)
- **What:** the merge must not carry a duplicate `type` or a shadowed top-level name.
- **How:** `python3 scripts/lexcheck.py` over the 4 sources, then over the merged file.
- **PASS:** exit 0, `lexcheck: PASS (0 findings)`.
- **FAIL:** any `COLLISION type` or `SHADOW <name>` row.

### T-02 · single declaration (L-4)
- **What:** exactly one `indicator()` call.
- **How:** `grep -c '^indicator(' merged`.
- **PASS:** `1`.

### T-03 · attribution retention (L-6/L-7)
- **What:** the CC BY-NC-SA notice and © LuxAlgo survive the rebrand.
- **How:** `grep -c 'LuxAlgo' merged`.
- **PASS:** `>= 1`.

### T-04 · per-subsystem render (W2 gate)
- **What:** each of the 4 subsystems draws on its own.
- **How:** POST /run per section slice; counts from `data.counts`.
- **PASS:** `boxes+labels+lines > 0` for each.
- **FAIL:** a section drawing 0/0/0.

### T-05 · full-artifact run (L0/L2)
- **What:** the whole merged file compiles and executes.
- **How:** `node pine-ide-fork/pv_probe.mjs <file> --url :9641`.
- **PASS:** `RUN_OK` + `RENDERED`, exit 0.

### T-06 · adversarial corpus (P5)
- **What:** 28 exported decision functions probed positive + negative + edge.
- **How:** `python3 scripts/p5_adversarial.py`.
- **PASS:** positive GREEN, negative GREEN, full-artifact 12/12 GREEN.

### T-07 · behavior diff (I-4)
- **What:** no formula changed during the rename.
- **How:** normalize identifiers, assert each core shape still present.
- **PASS:** 10/10 shapes.

VERDICT            FULL PASS — ZERO confirmed defects
```
Two STEP-4 rows were adjudicated as **probe errors**, not defects — see
`P5_ADVERSARIAL_VERDICT.md` (AUD/USD 30m is absent from the fixture corpus; `limit=1`
is below the fixture's minimum slice). One real finding was recorded: the §16 box
budget is documented but NOT enforced (3 of 12 cells within 40 boxes of the 500
ceiling). **Verdict: PASS with one named OPEN finding.**

## RE-MEASURED THIS TURN - the anchor every verdict above hangs from

Re-run after every edit. A PASS is a measurement, valid only for the SHA it was taken on.

```

If the SHA changes, every verdict above is STALE and the gates must re-run.

## THE AUDIT GATE

```
AUDIT GATE: BLOCKED (no code-audit artifact on disk for this artifact)
```

No `qwen-code-audit` / `sg-ocr-*.json` run exists for `plutus-vision-v0.pine`, and the
host's audit lane was not invoked this session. Per the degraded-run law this is
**BLOCKED, never PASS** — it does not block the build's own gates (every gate above is
independently evidenced by a tool result), but it **does** block any ship-ready or
production-grade claim. The audit must be run against the merged file before P8.

---

## THE HONEST GAPS

1. **TradingView itself is unverified.** Every gate above ran on PineTS 0.10.0. The
   eight engine-compat shims in `RUNTIME_LEDGER.md` are Pine-legal constructs, but no
   run has proved TradingView's compiler accepts the merged source, and no eyes have
   seen a rendered chart. The station is a *proxy*, not the target runtime.
2. **Visual parity is counts, not pixels.** SMC and VOIDS match their sources exactly on
   object counts (5/22/19 and 94/0/0). SWEEPS source 422s on PineTS so no parity number
   exists. POOLS draws 1 box where the source draws 8 — same gate shape, fewer clusters
   on 300 bars; threshold/bar-count dependent, NOT proven benign.
3. **The box budget is unenforced** (see R-T06). On a denser market the merged file
   exceeds Pine's 500 ceiling and PineTS drops the excess silently.
4. **AUDIT GATE BLOCKED** (above).
5. **Tier-1 LuxAlgo validation never started** — the 14 Tier-1 candidates and the
   Tier-2 reserves remain unvalidated by design.

## TEST PLAN ENTRY P-07 — 2026-10-01 — the computer-use rails
### HOST
- **What:** every theatrical shape must be a refusal, and the honest path must be one call.
- **How:** `node scripts/rail-test.mjs` (first pass) and `scripts/rail-test2.mjs` (theatre shapes), driving `execute()` against the LIVE `:3` display and the real Pine IDE window.
- **PASS criteria:** claim-without-evidence REFUSED · look returns an image block · PASS-with-deltas REFUSED · ack-without-reason REFUSED · verdict-without-look REFUSED · verdict-without-expectation REFUSED · honest FAIL recordable · claim-with-evidence generated with shas · report prints the look-ratio.
- **FAIL criteria:** any of the above permitted.
- **Status:** PASSED (R-07)

## TEST RESULT R-07 — 2026-10-01 — P-07 the rails
### HOST
- **The run:** `node scripts/rail-test2.mjs` (live, display :3, window 14680067 "Plutus Vision — Pine IDE")
- **The raw output:**
  `T1 claim with no evidence   ✓ CLAIM REFUSED — nothing behind it.`
  `T2 look (one call)          ✓ image ✓ sha 35d98e22  bytes 241210`
  `T3 PASS with deltas         ✓ VERDICT REFUSED — PASS with deltas is the theatrical shape.`
  `T4 PASS forced              ✓ VERDICT PASS (override logged)`
  `T5 ack with no reason       ✓ ACK REFUSED — 1 unobserved interaction(s) claimed as observed with no reason.`
  `T6 ack with reason          ✓ ACK: 1 interaction(s) marked observed WITHOUT a capture.`
  `T7 honest FAIL              ✓ VERDICT FAIL`
  `T8 claim with evidence      ✓ VERIFICATION CLAIM — generated from 2 recorded verdict(s) · overall: FAIL`
  `T9 audit surface            look-ratio 0.67 ⚠ · acks 1 · rail refusals 5 · PASS overrides 1`
- **AUDIT GATE:** REPLACED BY DIRECT LOOK by operator order (FAILURE_LOG F-34). The prior qwen-code-audit attempt returned `GATE: BLOCKED (OCR_NO_FILES_REVIEWED)`. No code-audit artifact exists for this project; the direct-look claim is the gate for this milestone and it carries shas per frame.
- **The verdict:** PASS (all 9 shapes behaved as designed)
- **The artifacts:** ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/runs.jsonl · ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/shots/*.png

## TEST RESULT R-08 — 2026-10-01 — the VLM reader is retired (live)
### HOST
- **The run:** `curl -X POST :9754/vil/look`
- **The raw output:** `{"success":true,"data":{"retired":true,"verdict":"TRIAGE_ONLY","answers":null,"note":"VLM_READER_RETIRED: the local-VLM reader no longer issues verdicts (2026-10-01)…"}}`
- **The verdict:** PASS — the second verdict path is closed; there is now exactly one.
- **The artifacts:** PLUTUS_VISION/pine-ide/pine-ide/vil-rail.mjs (`lookAt` retired, `lookAt__retired` preserved)

## TEST RESULT R-09 — 2026-10-01 — skill corpus wiring
### SCRIPT
- **The run:** grep for `⛔ RAIL — use \`computer-use\`` across ~/.omp/agent/managed-skills/*/SKILL.md; frontmatter check per file.
- **The raw output:** `wired: direct-look-product-test, l5-chart-vision-verification, tradingview-pine-l5-render, tradingview-agent-display-render, tradingview-agent-display-pine-render, agent-display-tradingview-pine-render, pine-ide, tradingview-pine-editor-cdp-load, tradingview-pine-render-agent-display, tradingview-pine-render-and-session` · `frontmatter ok (name fields=1) × 9`
- **The verdict:** PASS — 10/10 vision skills route through the tool; 0 prescribe a raw capture as the only path.

## TEST RESULT R-10 — 2026-10-01 — the served-artifact drift (found by looking)
### HOST
- **What:** the binary the IDE renders vs the file under test.
- **How:** read the editor's visible text in the frame, compare to the source, then hash the editor's contents in-page via `crypto.subtle.digest`.
- **The raw output:** `editorSha: d7e0060997316565 · servedSha: d7e0060997316565 · header: "// BUDGET: single 500/500/500 ceiling; allocation enforced in W3 (§16)"` vs source `605bff82d3539e9e` reading `// BUDGET: one script = one 500-box ceiling. Only VOIDS is bounded…`
- **The fix + re-verify:** symlink + universal `no-store` + dead server killed → `bash scripts/verify_served_pine.sh` → `source 605bff82d3539e9e  renderer 605bff82d3539e9e  served 605bff82d3539e9e / SERVED_PINE_OK`; after a hard reload `editorSha 605bff82d3539e9e · counts {boxes:122, labels:24, lines:57} · bars 1603`.
- **The verdict:** FAIL→FIXED+PROVEN. The delta it exposed — the stale `W3 BUDGET` block and the false `zero deltas` header visible in the editor — was itself a symptom; the cause was the served copy.
- **The artifacts:** vil/direct/05-1H-FINAL.png sha 87aec75ad5176399 · vil/direct/08-menu.png sha 8a692caeeb09f1a4

## TEST RESULT R-11 — 2026-10-01 — the verdict loop across processes
### HOST
- **The run:** `bash scripts/drive.sh` (reset → expect → click → look, four separate node processes) then `node scripts/sweep.mjs verdict 'FAIL|…'`
- **The raw output:** `expectation: 1H on 605bff82… / unobserved : 0 / win : 14680067` → `VERDICT FAIL · expectation: … · found: four subsystems render; legend row present; header lines 9-19 corrected; 3 anchors dropped matching parity · missing: 3 CHoCH labels cluster within ~20px at x1090-1163 y420-435`
- **The verdict:** PASS — expectation written first, interaction counted, frame opened, verdict recorded with a named delta and the frame's sha.
- **The artifacts:** ~/.omp/agent/run/computer-use/runs.jsonl

### NOT TESTED (honest remainder)
- No container round this session: every verdict is display-live, not container-grade.
- The look matrix covers 1H for all three after the D1 suppression; the other three TFs were
  measured by counts, not looked at.
- The grid's fidelity deltas are subjective and handed to the operator, not self-adjudicated.

## 2026-10-02 (later) — THE PIN EXECUTION · ALL 12 NAMED TESTS + THE AUDIT GATE

### THE AUDIT ARTIFACT
`reports/LQZ_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.txt` — the full pass, on disk, with the artifact shas at
audit time written into its header (so the audit names WHAT it audited).

## AUDIT GATE: PASS

```
  [PASS] A1 detector paint suppressed                 live colour inputs=0 transparent=10
  [PASS] A2 drawing caps raised to 500                per-deliverable: [True, True, True]
  [PASS] A3 mutant: wrong title refused               exit=1
  [PASS] A4 mutant: duplicate panels refused          exit=1 guarded
  [PASS] A5 grid artifact present                     panel-grid-1H.png 523703 bytes
  [PASS] A6 ledger carries the frame shas             3/3 shas cited
  [PASS] A7 library cross-reference clean             library 5/5 bands>0 irregular 5/5 · grids 4/4 bands>0 irregular 4/4

ADVERSARIAL VERDICT: 7/7 PASS
ZERO confirmed defects — every guard bit its mutant
```

**AUDIT GATE: PASS** — 7/7, zero confirmed defects, artifact on disk.

### WAVE 1 — `bun test scripts/lqz_core.test.ts` → 4 pass / 0 fail / 46 expect
| named test | selector | result |
|---|---|---|
| test_cluster_rejects_beyond_tol (negative, runs first) | `bun test -t test_cluster_rejects_beyond_tol` | pass |
| test_cluster_merges_within_tol (positive) | `bun test -t test_cluster_merges_within_tol` | pass |
| test_source_select_is_total (exhaustive) | `bun test -t test_source_select_is_total` | pass |
Gate: v0 parity ZERO new deltas — verified: `plutus-vision-v0.pine` sha `605bff82d3539e9e`,
byte-identical to the pin's baseline. **The parity reference was not touched.**

### WAVE 2 — `bun test scripts/lqz_render.test.ts` → 2 pass / 0 fail / 45 expect
test_zone_spans_full_width · test_colour_by_side. Positive + negative + empty in each.
Gate: every zone left edge <= bar_index-500 — verified at barIndex **1603** AND at **325**
(15m's depth) where the clamp holds the edge at 0 rather than going negative.

### WAVES 3/4/5 — `bun test scripts/lqz_ship.test.ts` → 3 pass / 0 fail / 40 expect
Each asserts the STATION compile (L0) with the run's OWN title AND the source law (L1):
| deliverable | sha256[:16] | station title asserted |
|---|---|---|
| D1 lqz-luxalgo | `b6dda2dae4416ec8` | `LQZ LuxAlgo` |
| D2 lqz-plutus | `946f4ca21b3ddc0a` | `LQZ Plutus — operator candle liquidity` |
| D3 plutus-vision-v1 | `d41c6d9ccb1c5f8e` | `Plutus Vision v1` |

### WAVE 6 — `bun test scripts/lqz_w6.test.ts` → 3 pass / 0 fail / 51 expect
test_panel_grid_complete · test_panel_rows_are_same_bars · test_ab_diff_is_measurable.

### THE PANEL VISUAL JUDGE GATE (L3/L4) — the pin's only deliverable-closing gate
Four grids, each rendered LIVE from the Pine IDE on :3, each OPENED by the agent:

| TF | grid | sha256[:16] | D1 | D2 | D3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1H | reports/panel-grid-1H.png | 07a4e3bc | 117b/36l | 0b/58l | 5b/79l/21L |
| 30m | reports/panel-grid-30m.png | 0491c90a | 145b/40l | 0b/66l | 5b/85l/19L |
| 15m | reports/panel-grid-15m.png | 5f4fcbb2 | 97b/30l | 0b/38l | 5b/57l/19L |
| 4H | reports/panel-grid-4H.png | a653c020 | 216b/50l | 0b/53l | 5b/80l/27L |

Per-panel found/missing/wrong: `reports/lqz_panel_judge.md`.
**OPERATOR VERDICT: AWAITING — no agent action substitutes for it.**

### THE RUNTIME SEAT (P4) — first person on :3
`reports/lqz_runtime_forensic.md` (154 L) carries the H1-H7 record: 8 numbered ops each
with a pre-registered expectation; the silent station death; the cold-page debounce race
(1/2/7 attempts cold vs 1/1/1 warm); the 15m shallow-history case; the 112-vs-50 cap
boundary; seven facts RUNNING produced that READING could not.

### THE LIBRARY CROSS-REFERENCE (P5)
Decisive property: **IRREGULARITY**, not the count. Measured: library 5/5 frames bands>0
AND irregular · deliverable grids 4/4 bands>0 AND irregular. A uniform spacing would be a
synthetic grid; irregular spacing is detected levels.

### NOT TESTED (the honest remainder — never reported as pass)
- **No container round.** Every verdict is host-live, not container-grade.
- **No rig crash test** beyond `limit=1` (which refuses by name: `bars absent (1)`).
- **The second-operator check is not run** — no zero-context subagent has driven it.
- **The band-height delta is unadjudicated** — the operator's call.
- render vision.mjs sha at test time: `56e9a3eb1d83e43d` · HEAD `d7dc0ce`
